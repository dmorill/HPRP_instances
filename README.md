//---- Additional Benchmark instances for the Pollution-Routing Problem ----\\
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\

Adapted from kramer instances

- Adding to the benchmark instances from the PRPLIB, this new benchmark consists of two additional sets (Set B and Set C) of instances with tighter time windows. 
- The time horizon of these new sets is 32400 seconds (as in those from the PRPLIB).
- The time-window width of each customer in Set B was randomly selected between the interval [2000, 5000] seconds with uniform probability, whereas in Set C it was randomly selected between [2000, 15000] seconds.
- Each set contains nine different groups with 20 instances, resulting in 360 new instances.
- The groups are separated according to the number of customers, varying from 10 to 200 customers.
